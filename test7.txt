Purpose: This test is written to see how the kernel will handle the messaging system
by sending a message to a process that is not actively receiving a message. The reciever
buffer is larger than the sender.

Date: 12 Nov 2017

Setup: The following processes are used as input to the kernel system:
void proc1 (void)
{
    pbind(1);
    pnice(2);
    psend(2,"Hello", 6);
    while(1);
}

void proc2 (void)
{
    int src_id,size;
    char x[4];
    char p[10] = "proc = x";
    char s[10] = "size = x";
    pbind(2);
    pnice(2);
    size = precv(&src_id,x,4);
    p[7] = src_id + '0';
    s[7] = size   + '0';
    pdisplay_str(1,1,p);
    pdisplay_str(1,2,s);
    pdisplay_str(1,3,x);
    while (1);
}
Steps:
	1- write process code in specified file
	2- register processes in registration list
	3- configure UART terminal to see output
	4- Compile program
	5- Run

Expected output:

The first three lines in the UART terminal are going to look like:
proc = 1
size = 4
Hel


This test is different than test 6 because the buffer of process 2 is now only 4 
	Characters wide which is not enough to hold "HELLO". Therefore,
	Only three letters show, even though the buffer size is four, because 
	the NUL character is enforced as the last character in the buffer by precv

Result:
Success
