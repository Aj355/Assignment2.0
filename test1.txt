Purpose: This test is written to see how the kernel will handle UART display requests
		by having the processes request to display a string on the specified
		cursor location. No window manager is used to conduct this test.
		Note: pdisplay arguments are column, row, and msg, respectively.

Date: 10 Nov 2017

Setup: The following processes are used as input to the kernel system:

	process1:

    pdisplay_str(1,2,"I am process # 1");
    while(1);


	process2:

    pdisplay_str(1,2,"I am process # 2");
    while (1);

	process3:

    pdisplay_str(1,3,"I am process # 3");
    while (1);


Steps:
	1- write process code in specified file
	2- register processes in registration list
	3- configure UART terminal to see output
	4- Compile program
	5- Run

Expected output:
The first three lines in the UART terminal are going to look like:
I am process # 1
I am process # 2
I am process # 3

Result:
Success
