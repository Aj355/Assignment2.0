Purpose: This test is written to see how the kernel will handle pnice command which
		changes the priority of the calling process to the specified priority.

Date: 10 Nov 2017

Setup: The following processes are used as input to the kernel system:

void proc1 (void)
{
    pdisplay_str(1,1,"I am proc 1, my priority is high");
    pnice(2);
    pdisplay_str(1,3,"I am proc 1, my priority is medium");
    while (1);
}

void proc2 (void)
{
    pdisplay_str(1,2,"I am proc 2, my priority is high");
    pnice(2);
    pdisplay_str(1,4,"I am proc 2, my priority is medium");
    while (1);
}


Steps:
	1- write process code in specified file
	2- register processes in registration list
	3- configure UART terminal to see output
	4- Compile program
	5- Run

Expected output:
The first four lines in the UART terminal are going to look like:
I am proc 1, my priority is high
I am proc 2, my priority is high
I am proc 1, my priority is medium
I am proc 2, my priority is medium


Result:
Success
