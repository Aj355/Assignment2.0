Purpose: This test is written to see how the kernel will handle time server
		requests where a process requests to sleep a certain amount 
		of time

Date: 14 Nov 2017

Setup: The following processes are used as input to the kernel system:

void proc1 (void)
{
    sleep(50);
    psidplay_str(1,1,"I am process one. I should run first but i slept by mistake");
    while (1);
}

void proc2 (void)
{
    psidplay_str(1,2,"I am process two, i sneaked in when process one was asleep");
    while(1);
}

Steps:
	1- write process code in specified file
	2- register processes in registration list
	3- configure UART terminal to see output
	4- Compile program
	5- Run

Expected output:


I am process one. I should run first but i slept by mistake
I am process two, i sneaked in when process one was asleep

The order of the statement is the second statement, delay for about 5 second, 
	and the first statement appears
Result:
Success
