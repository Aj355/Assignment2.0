Purpose: This test is written to see how the kernel will handle get ID command 
		The result is displayed to the screen using UART display command

Date: 10 Nov 2017

Setup: The following processes are used as input to the kernel system:

    void proc1 (void)
{
    
    char ID[2];
    ID[0] = pgetid() + '0';
    ID[1] = '\0';
    pdisplay_str(1,1,ID);
    while(1);
}



Steps:
	1- write process code in specified file
	2- register processes in registration list
	3- configure UART terminal to see output
	4- Compile program
	5- Run

Expected output:
The first line in the UART terminal should display 5 since proc1 is the 
first user (and only) user process to be registered. process IDs 0 to 4 are
reserved for system (kernel) use.


Result:
Success
