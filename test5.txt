Purpose: This test is written to see how the kernel will bind processes to message mailboxes

Date: 10 Nov 2017

Setup: The following processes are used as input to the kernel system:

void proc1 (void)
{
    char x[2];
    x[0] = pbind(1) + '0';
    x[1] = '\0';
    pdisplay_str(1,1,x);
    x[0] = pbind(2)+ '1';
    pdisplay_str(1,3,x);
    while(1);
}

void proc2 (void)
{
    char x[2];
    x[0] = pbind(2)+ '0';
    x[1] = '\0';
    pdisplay_str(1,2,x);
    while (1);
}


Steps:
	1- write process code in specified file
	2- register processes in registration list
	3- configure UART terminal to see output
	4- Compile program
	5- Run

Expected output:
The first three lines in the UART terminal are going to look like:
1
2
0 
Note: the bind command returns -1 on a failure. in order to display -1 in UART as a character
	+ '1' is added to it which yeilds the number 0 as expected. 

Result:
Success
