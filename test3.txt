Purpose: This test is written to see how the kernel will handle termination of processes
		by running a high priority process, terminate it, and then run a lower 
		priority process

Date: 10 Nov 2017

Setup: The following processes are used as input to the kernel system:

void proc1 (void)
{
    pdisplay_str(1,1,"I am process 1, my priority is high, and I am terminating now");
}

void proc2 (void)
{
    pdisplay_str(1,2,"I am process 2.");
    while (1);
}


Steps:
	1- write process code in specified file
	2- register processes in registration list
	3- configure UART terminal to see output
	4- Compile program
	5- Run

Expected output:
The first two lines in the UART terminal are going to look like:
I am process 1, my priority is high, and I am terminating now
I am process 2.


Result:
Success
